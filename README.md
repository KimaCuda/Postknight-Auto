# Postknight-auto
Automation for Postknight game

Working on LD Player with 460x860 resolution

A small Postknight Automation project I created for fun. This auto can:
- Move from the current place to the destination. (can be done even if you're still in the inventory window, etc.)
- Fully automated combat phase. Works when you're dead in the middle too.
- Able to detect hard enemies. It can trigger safe mode while so in combat (not using charge skill if the shield skill isn't active).
- Can check board quest, delivery quest and record the timer.

Future implementation:
- Auto gifting and receiving (both pets and girls). High priority.
- Auto Buy item from the merchant. Mid Priority. 
- Auto division item contribution. Low Priority.
- Auto pot and weapon upgrade aren't on my list right now since mine is already maxed out.

Will try to add other emulators to work with later.
